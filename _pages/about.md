Hi, I'm Feng Jianting(*Chinese: å†¯å»ºéœ†*), an upcoming (2023 Fall) postgraduate student in the CUHK, my major interests lie in the field of **statistical machine learning**, **causal inference** and **explainable artificial intelligence**(XAI). Prior to this, I was an undergraduate student in the Beijing Institute of Technology, majoring in Mathematics and supervised by [Prof. Man Hongyin](https://math.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jgml/jsyxtkxx/mhy/index.htm).

Apart from learning and writing, I enjoy contributing to the open source projects, and I am addicted to coffee, football ([ManCity](mancity.com)) and Formula 1.

If you are interested in discussion with me, please send me a email to [ðŸ“­gianting01@gmail.com](gianting01@gmail.com).
