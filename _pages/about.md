Hi, I'm Feng Jianting(Chinese: å†¯å»ºéœ†), a future postgraduate student at CUHK starting in the fall of 2023. 

My areas of interest include statistical machine learning, causal inference, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). I obtained my undergraduate degree from the Beijing Institute of Technology, where I majored in Mathematics and was supervised by [Prof. Man Hongyin](https://math.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jgml/jsyxtkxx/mhy/index.htm).

In addition to academics, I have a passion for coding and contributing to open source projects and enjoy spending my free time with coffee and formula 1. If you'd like to connect and engage in discussions, feel free to email me at [ðŸ“­gianting01@gmail.com](gianting01@gmail.com).

Additional information, please refer my [resume](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf).
